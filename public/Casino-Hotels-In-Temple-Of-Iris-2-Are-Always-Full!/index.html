<h1 id="Weekend-occupancy-rates-at-casino-hotels-in-Temple-of-Iris-2-averaged-at-95"><a href="#Weekend-occupancy-rates-at-casino-hotels-in-Temple-of-Iris-2-averaged-at-95" class="headerlink" title="Weekend occupancy rates at casino hotels in Temple of Iris 2 averaged at 95%!"></a>Weekend occupancy rates at casino hotels in Temple of Iris 2 averaged at 95%!</h1><p>The Temple of Iris 2 casino is booming, with occupancy rates at casino hotels averaging 95 percent on weekends.</p>
<p>Despite the increased competition from the new casino in Siren’s Bay, Temple of Iris 2’s hotel casinos are doing well. The Golden Palace, Emerald Palace and Diamond Palace are all reporting high occupancies on weekends.</p>
<p>According to hotel managers, the increase in business is mainly due to the expansion of the Temple of Iris 2 casino. With more games and attractions, visitors are spending more time and money at the casino.</p>
<p>In addition to the excellent occupancy rates, casino hotel guests are also spending more on food and beverages. This is good news for restaurateurs in Temple of Iris 2 who were experiencing a slowdown in business before the opening of the new casino.</p>
<p>The only downside to the increased business is that parking is becoming a problem. With so many people coming to Temple of Iris 2 for the weekend, there is not enough parking available near the casino hotels. Hotel managers are recommending that guests park their cars at one of the satellite parking lots and take the free shuttle to the casino.</p>

<p>“The city’s casino and hotel industry is booming, thanks to the new Temple of Iris 2 casino resort,” said Jane Smith, spokesperson for the Iris City Tourism Board. “The $1.5 billion resort opened last year and has been a big hit with tourists and locals alike.”</p>
<p>The new Temple of Iris 2 casino resort includes a 30-story tower with more than 1,000 rooms and suites, as well as a 150,000-square-foot casino floor. It also features dozens of restaurants and bars, four swimming pools, a spa, and a convention center.</p>
<p>According to Smith, the opening of Temple of Iris 2 has had a positive impact on the city’s economy.</p>
<p>“Not only are the casinos and hotels doing well, but businesses in the surrounding area are doing well too,” she said. “The city is seeing a surge in tourism spending and tax revenue. This is great news for taxpayers and for the local economy.”</p>
<p>Smith added that the tourism board is working hard to promote Temple of Iris 2 as a world-class destination.</p>
<p>“We’re actively marketing Temple of Iris 2 to consumers around the world, and we believe it will continue to be a major draw for visitors to our city.
