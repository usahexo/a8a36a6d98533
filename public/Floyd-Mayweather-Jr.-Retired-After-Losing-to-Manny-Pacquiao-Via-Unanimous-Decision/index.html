            <h1 id="Floyd-Mayweather-Jr-Retired-After-Losing-to-Manny-Pacquiao-Via-Unanimous-Decision"><a href="#Floyd-Mayweather-Jr-Retired-After-Losing-to-Manny-Pacquiao-Via-Unanimous-Decision" class="headerlink" title="Floyd Mayweather Jr. Retired After Losing to Manny Pacquiao Via Unanimous Decision"></a>Floyd Mayweather Jr. Retired After Losing to Manny Pacquiao Via Unanimous Decision</h1><p>Mayweather, 38, announced his retirement from boxing in a post on Shots social media app Saturday night after losing to Pacquiao via unanimous decision in the welterweight world championship bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.<br>“I am truly thankful for the opportunities that Floyd Mayweather Jr. has given me,” Mayweather wrote on Shots. “I am a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and I want to thank all the fans who have come to see me and support me throughout my career.</p>
<p>“I did not lose tonight. I did not win tonight.”</p>
<p>The five-division world champion said he is “still undefeated.”<br>“This was my last fight,” Mayweather wrote. “For sure.”<br>Pacquiao (57-6-2, 38 KOs), who earned $120 million for the fight, was ahead on all three judges’ scorecards heading into the 12th round. Mayweather (48-0, 26 KOs) then came on strong and appeared to win the final round on two of the scorecards. However, it wasn’t enough to offset the deficit from earlier rounds.<br>Mayweather would later take to Twitter to state that he actually won the fight by two rounds:</p>
<h1 id="Mayweather-Promotions-Officially-Closes-Its-Doors"><a href="#Mayweather-Promotions-Officially-Closes-Its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Mayweather Promotions Officially Closes Its Doors"></a>Mayweather Promotions Officially Closes Its Doors</h1><p>In a major development for the sport of boxing, Mayweather Promotions has announced that it is officially closing its doors. The organization was founded by Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2007 and enjoyed great success in promoting some of the biggest names in the sport.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Tuesday,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> Mayweather Promotions cited the “changing landscape of the boxing business” as the reason behind its closure. The company also thanked all of its employees, partners and fans for their support over the years.</p>
<p>While it is unclear what this will mean for the future of Mayweather Promotions’ fighters, it is likely that they will now look to sign with other promotions. This includes current world champion Terence Crawford, who is promoted by Top Rank Boxing.</p>
<p>Crawford is considered one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in the world and is coming off an impressive win over Amir Khan in April. He is scheduled to face off against Egidijus Kavaliauskas in December, with his next move after that up in the air.</p>
<p>Mayweather Promotions was largely responsible for building Crawford into a superstar, and it will be interesting to see if he can continue his success without them.</p>
<h1 id="Tony-Parker-Announces-Retirement-After-18-Seasons-in-the-NBA"><a href="#Tony-Parker-Announces-Retirement-After-18-Seasons-in-the-NBA" class="headerlink" title="Tony Parker Announces Retirement After 18 Seasons in the NBA"></a>Tony Parker Announces Retirement After 18 Seasons in the NBA</h1><p>Tony Parker, a future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, announced his retirement from the NBA on Monday after 18 seasons. The 6-foot-2 guard is a four-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and Finals MVP (2007).</p>
<p>“It’s with great sadness that I announce my retirement from basketball,” Parker said in a statement released by the Spurs. “It’s been an incredible journey and I’ve been very lucky to have played for 16 years with the San Antonio Spurs. Coach Gregg Popovich gave me my start in the NBA and I will always be grateful to him.”</p>
<p>Parker was selected by the Spurs with the 28th overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft and spent his entire career with the franchise. He ranks fourth all-time in assists (6,827) and seventh in games played (1,305), while averaging 15.5 points and 5.6 assists per game.</p>
<p>“Tony has been an amazing player for us over the years and we are grateful for everything he has done for the Spurs organization and our fans,” Popovich said. “He has always carried himself in a professional manner on and off the court and represented us with class both in San Antonio and abroad. We wish Tony all the best in his retirement.”</p>
<h1 id="Lakers-Hire-David-Fizdale-as-Head-Coach"><a href="#Lakers-Hire-David-Fizdale-as-Head-Coach" class="headerlink" title="Lakers Hire David Fizdale as Head Coach"></a>Lakers Hire David Fizdale as Head Coach</h1><p>The Los Angeles Lakers have hired David Fizdale as their new head coach. Fizdale comes from the Miami Heat, where he was an assistant coach. He has a lot of experience coaching in the NBA and is known for his strong relationships with players.</p>
<p>Lakers President of Basketball Operations Magic Johnson said, “We are excited to add David to our organization. He is a great teacher and has a proven track record with players. We believe that he will help us reach our ultimate goal of winning an NBA championship.”</p>
<p>Coach Fizdale is looking forward to getting started with the Lakers. “I am thrilled to join the Lakers and work alongside Magic and Rob. I am passionate about this game and about winning, and I look forward to teaching and leading this team on the court,” he said.</p>
<p>The Lakers have been rebuilding over the past few years and are hoping that Coach Fizdale can lead them back to glory.</p>
<h1 id="Warriors-Sign-DeMarcus-Cousins"><a href="#Warriors-Sign-DeMarcus-Cousins" class="headerlink" title="Warriors Sign DeMarcus Cousins"></a>Warriors Sign DeMarcus Cousins</h1><p>After losing Kevin Durant to free agency, the Golden State Warriors have signed DeMarcus Cousins to a one-year, $5.3 million contract.</p>
<p>Cousins, a four-time All-Star, is coming off a season in which he averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.6 blocks in 48 games with the New Orleans Pelicans. He missed the final 48 games of the regular season and the playoffs after tearing his left Achilles tendon on January 26.</p>
<p>The signing of Cousins gives the Warriors another superstar player alongside Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The addition of Cousins could lead to the Warriors becoming the first team ever to win three consecutive NBA titles.</p>
<p>Cousins has said that he is not concerned about being injured and that he is 100 percent healthy. “I’m not worried about it at all,” Cousins said. “I spoke to a lot of people who had the injury and there’s different ways to approach it. I plan on attacking this thing fearlessly and hopefully I can come back better than ever.”</p>
<p>Warriors head coach Steve Kerr is also not concerned about Cousins’ injury history. “I don’t think there’s any concern,” Kerr said. “We have a great medical staff and they’ll put him through his paces here in the next few weeks and months and see where he’s at.”</p>
<p>Cousins is expected to miss six to eight months while recovering from his Achilles injury, which means he would return in time for the playoffs.</p>
