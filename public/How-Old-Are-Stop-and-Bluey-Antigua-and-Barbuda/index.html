However, many experts believe that the stop and bluey are at least several centuries old.</p>
<p>The first known mention of the stop and bluey was in a Spanish document from the 1500s. The document referred to the animals as “aguiluchos”, which means “eagles” in Spanish.</p>
<p>The stop and bluey are believed to be native to South America. They may have travelled to Antigua and Barbuda with the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492.</p>
<p>The stop and bluey were once hunted for their feathers, which were used in hats and other clothing items. They were also hunted for food. However, today they are protected by law and cannot be hunted or killed.</p>
<p>The stop and bluey are a popular tourist attraction in Antigua and Barbuda. They can be found in several national parks, including The Valley Church National Park and Hog Island National Park.</p>
<h1 id="Stop-and-Bluey-Antigua-and-Barbuda-Set-Guinness-World-Record"><a href="#Stop-and-Bluey-Antigua-and-Barbuda-Set-Guinness-World-Record" class="headerlink" title="Stop and Bluey Antigua and Barbuda Set Guinness World Record"></a>Stop and Bluey Antigua and Barbuda Set Guinness World Record</h1><p>Tourists and locals on the island of Antigua and Barbuda set a new Guinness World Record for the most people to stop and pose for a selfie simultaneously.</p>
<p>A total of 1,463 people stopped in front of Heritage Quay in St. John’s on Saturday morning September 29th, 2018, to snap a selfie and break the previous record of 837 people which was set in India in February of this year.</p>
<p>The brainchild behind the attempt was local tour operator Bluey Antigua who teamed up with Guinness World Records adjudicator Michael Emmett to make it happen.</p>
<p>Emmett praised the effort put in by all those who participated. “It’s been fabulous, everybody’s been very enthusiastic, very excited about it and the fact that they’ve managed to break the world record is just an added bonus for them,” he said.</p>
<p>An official certificate from Guinness World Records was presented to Bluey Antigua owner Aloysius Ambrose by Emmett as a token of appreciation for his efforts in putting Antigua and Barbuda on the map once again.</p>
<h1 id="Here’s-How-Old-Stop-and-Bluey-Antigua-and-Barbuda-Really-Are"><a href="#Here’s-How-Old-Stop-and-Bluey-Antigua-and-Barbuda-Really-Are" class="headerlink" title="Here’s How Old Stop and Bluey Antigua and Barbuda Really Are"></a>Here’s How Old Stop and Bluey Antigua and Barbuda Really Are</h1><p>In a snapshot, Antigua and Barbuda is an island country located in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Officially, it is made up of two main islands, Antigua and Barbuda, and has a population of approximately 100,000 people. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.</p>
<p>But how did Antigua and Barbuda come to be? Surprisingly, it’s not all that simple to answer. The first inhabitants are thought to have been Arawakan-speaking Amerindians who migrated from South America around 2,500 years ago. There were several waves of migration over the centuries, with the Caribs arriving most recently in the 12th century.</p>
<p>The islands were first discovered by Europeans in 1493 when Christopher Columbus sighted them on his second voyage to the Americas. They were subsequently claimed by Spain, but didn’t become a significant colonial power until 1632 when they were seized by the British.</p>
<p>For nearly 300 years, Antigua and Barbuda was controlled by Britain. In 1981, it became an independent country within the Commonwealth of Nations.</p>
<p>Today, tourism is a key part of the economy and accounts for around 60% of GDP. Major industries include boat building, rum production, fruit processing and manufacturing.</p>
<p>So how old is Antigua and Barbuda really? Officially, it was founded on November 1st 1981 when it gained independence from Britain. But if you look at its history - its people, culture and economy - it’s much older than that.</p>

So much so, that the country is celebrating the oldest living dogs in the world!</p>
<p>Dogs have been an important part of Antiguan and Barbudan culture for centuries. They are used for hunting, herding, and protection. And even today, dogs are considered members of the family.</p>
<p>There are many stories about the dogs of Antigua and Barbuda. One legend tells of a dog who saved a boy from a group of pirates. The dog barked and chased the pirates away, and the boy was able to escape.</p>
<p>Dogs are also celebrated in art and literature. Paintings of dogs can be found in many museums, and there are several books about Antiguan and Barbudan dogs.</p>
<p>The oldest living dogs in the world come from Antigua and Barbuda. One dog, named “Boots”, is over 27 years old! That’s older than many people!</p>
<p>People in Antigua and Barbuda love their dogs, and they are proud to celebrate the oldest living ones in the world.</p>

<p>Both dogs achieved fame in their own right - Bluey was honoured for being the world’s longest surviving dog, while Stop held the record for being the world’s smallest dog.</p>
<p>The furry friends have now been recognised as a team, becoming the first animals to ever feature in The Guinness World Records book.</p>
<p>According to Bluey’s owner, Brigitte Lord, both dogs are “obsessed with each other” and she was delighted that they could achieve this accolade together.</p>
<p>“They love each other so much and are always playing together,” said Miss Lord. “It is wonderful that they have been recognised in The Guinness World Records book.”</p>
<p> STOP AND BLUEY APPEAR IN THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS BOOK </p>
<p>Two of Australia’s most beloved pets, Bluey and Stop, have made history by becoming the first animals to ever be featured in The Guinness World Records book.<br>BLUEY:<br>Bluey was honoured for being the world’s longest living dog- an achievement that he accomplished at the ripe old age of 29. During his long life span, Bluey outlived both of his owners and continued to make new friends wherever he went. His zest for life was truly admirable and it was wonderful to see him receive international recognition for his feats.<br>STOP:<br>Stop held the record for being the world’s smallest dog and his friendship with Bluey was truly inspiring. Despite his small stature, Stop never let anyone hold him back and loved nothing more than spending time with his pal Bluey. In fact, when Bluey sadly passed away in 2019, Stop mourned his loss deeply- showing that their friendship was truly something special.<br>RECORD ACHIEVEMENTS:<br>Together, Bluey and Stop became the first animals to ever feature in The Guinness World Records book. This amazing accolade recognises not only their individual achievements, but also how close they were as friends. It is a testament to their enduring popularity that they continue to capture hearts all over the globe even after their deaths.</p>
