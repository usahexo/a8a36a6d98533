            <h1 id="Indian-Reservations-To-Allow-Gaming-To-Help-Boost-Economies"><a href="#Indian-Reservations-To-Allow-Gaming-To-Help-Boost-Economies" class="headerlink" title="Indian Reservations To Allow Gaming To Help Boost Economies"></a>Indian Reservations To Allow Gaming To Help Boost Economies</h1><p>Indian Reservations have long been known for their casinos that have brought in tourism and revenue to the reservations and their states. A new bill proposed in the Senate would allow all Indian Reservations to offer gaming in order to help boost the economy.</p>
<p>The bill, called the Tribal Economic Development and Self-Determination Act of 2017, was introduced by Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND). The two senators say that they are introducing the bill in order to help tribal communities across the United States.</p>
<p>The act would amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 and allow any tribe that is eligible for gaming to offer it on their reservation. The tribes would also be able to negotiate their own gaming compacts with the state in which they reside.</p>
<p>“Tribes across America are looking for ways to create jobs and spur economic development,” said Senator Barrasso in a press release about the bill. “This bipartisan legislation will give tribal communities more flexibility to develop gaming enterprises and promote economic growth.”</p>
<p>Senator Heitkamp also released a statement about the bill, saying, “This commonsense legislation will give tribes more opportunities to use gaming as a tool for economic development – creating good-paying jobs and stimulating growth in tribal communities.”</p>
<p>Many tribes have been pushing for this change for years, as the current law does not allow them much flexibility when it comes to using gaming as an economic development tool. Currently, only certain tribes are allowed to offer gaming, and they are limited in what they can offer. For example, some tribes can only offer bingo or card games, while others can offer slot machines and other casino games.</p>
<p>If this new bill is passed, it will give all tribes the opportunity to offer a wider variety of gaming options on their reservations, which could potentially lead to more tourism and revenue for those reservations and their states.</p>
<h1 id="Tribes-Vote-To-Legalize-Slot-Machines-And-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Tribes-Vote-To-Legalize-Slot-Machines-And-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Tribes Vote To Legalize Slot Machines And Casino Gambling"></a>Tribes Vote To Legalize Slot Machines And Casino Gambling</h1><p>In a sweeping victory, the leaders of the Pokwat and Kwaza tribes have voted to legalize slot machines and casino gambling in their territories. The vote was seen as a way to generate much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped tribes.</p>
<p>Both Pokwat and Kwaza tribal leaders expressed confidence that the introduction of slot machines and casinos would be a success. Pokwat Chief Frank “The Hammer” Webster said that his tribe had been considering the move for some time, as they were looking for ways to increase revenue.</p>
<p>Kwaza Chief Wallace “Tiny” Thomas was equally bullish on the prospects for legalized gambling. He said that his tribe had been hit hard by the economic downturn and that legalizing gambling would help to create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.</p>
<p>Gambling opponents argued that the introduction ofslot machines and casinos would lead to social problems, such as addiction and crime. However, tribal leaders rejected these claims, saying that they had put in place safeguards to prevent such problems from arising.</p>
<h1 id="Native-American-Tribes-Embrace-Gaming-To-Preserve-Their-Cultures"><a href="#Native-American-Tribes-Embrace-Gaming-To-Preserve-Their-Cultures" class="headerlink" title="Native American Tribes Embrace Gaming To Preserve Their Cultures"></a>Native American Tribes Embrace Gaming To Preserve Their Cultures</h1><p>In recent years, many Native American tribes have turned to gaming as a way to preserve their cultures. While casinos and bingo halls have been around for decades, tribes are now starting to create their own video games and online platforms.</p>
<p>One of the most popular games is “Skins II”, which is set in the world of the Powhatan tribe in Virginia. Players can choose from a variety of character skins, including Creek, Navajo, and Chickasaw. The game has been a major success, with over 250,000 downloads since it was released in 2016.</p>
<p>Other tribes are also getting into the gaming industry. The Fredrick-Fulton County tribe in Oklahoma has developed a tribal game app called “Crazy Horse Casino”. The app allows players to experience traditional American Indian games such as stickball and chunkey.</p>
<p>The Seneca Nation of New York has also created its own online casino, which offers players the chance to win real money prizes. The casino is based on the tribe’s history and culture, and includes games such as blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>So why are Native American tribes turning to gaming? There are a number of reasons. For one thing, gaming provides much-needed revenue for many tribes. It can also help preserve traditional cultures and create jobs for tribal members.</p>
<p>Gaming can also be a way to raise awareness about Native American cultures and issues. By playing these games, people can learn about the customs and history of different tribes. This is important given that many people only have limited knowledge about Native Americans plight.</p>
<p>The popularity of gaming among Native Americans is likely to continue growing in the years ahead. This provides an opportunity for tribes to share their cultures with the rest of the world while generating much-needed revenue</p>
<h1 id="New-Gaming-Establishments-On-Indian-Reservations-Benefit-Local-Economies"><a href="#New-Gaming-Establishments-On-Indian-Reservations-Benefit-Local-Economies" class="headerlink" title="New Gaming Establishments On Indian Reservations Benefit Local Economies"></a>New Gaming Establishments On Indian Reservations Benefit Local Economies</h1><p>Gaming establishments on Indian reservations have created a new opportunity for economic development in many rural and tribal communities across the United States. These businesses generate vital revenue streams for tribes, providing essential funding for government services and creating jobs for tribal members.</p>
<p>Although gaming on Indian reservations has been around for over 25 years, it is only recently that tribes have begun to take full advantage of this economic opportunity. Gaming businesses are being developed and operated by tribes themselves, rather than outside interests, resulting in a more sustainable and culturally appropriate form of economic development.</p>
<p>One notable example is the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut, which is owned and operated by the Mohegan Tribe. The Mohegan Sun generated over $1.3 billion in revenue in 2016, making it one of the most successful gaming establishments in the country. The money generated by the casino has been used to fund vital tribal programs such as education, healthcare, and social services.</p>
<p>The success of gaming businesses on Indian reservations has not gone unnoticed by state and federal governments. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to promote and support Indian gaming through legislative and regulatory reform. For example, the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was created in 1988 to regulate Indian gaming activities nationwide.</p>
<p>The NIGC has been instrumental in promoting the growth of Indian gaming by developing regulations that ensure the integrity of the industry while also protecting the rights of tribes. The commission also provides technical assistance to tribes seeking to develop their own gaming enterprises.</p>
<p>Through its work, the NIGC has helped contribute to the growth of Indian gaming from a small collection of games played on a few reservations to a major force in the national economy. In 2016, Indian casinos generated over $31 billion in revenue and employed almost 400,000 people.</p>
<p>The success of Indian gaming demonstrates that tribes are capable of developing their own economies and providing vital government services to their members. Tribes can achieve this success through initiatives such as gaming enterprises, which provide much-needed jobs and revenue streams for these communities.</p>
<h1 id="Tribal-Gaming-Provides-Important-Economic-Development-Opportunities"><a href="#Tribal-Gaming-Provides-Important-Economic-Development-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Tribal Gaming Provides Important Economic Development Opportunities"></a>Tribal Gaming Provides Important Economic Development Opportunities</h1><p>In many parts of the United States, Native American tribal gaming is providing important economic development opportunities. According to a report from the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA), tribal gaming establishments generated nearly $32 billion in revenue in 2017, and employed over 454,000 people.</p>
<p>Tribal gaming is big business, and it’s growing rapidly. The NIGA report found that revenue from tribal gaming has grown by an average of more than 9 percent annually since 2012. That growth is translating into tangible benefits for tribal communities. In addition to creating jobs, tribal gaming revenues are helping to fund vital social and public services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.</p>
<p>There are now Nearly 450 Indian gaming operations nationwide spread across 29 states. The largest segment of the Native American casino market is “Class III” casinos, which offer traditional casino games such as slots, blackjack, poker, and roulette. Revenue from Class III tribal gaming establishments accounts for more than three-quarters of all tribal casino revenue.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, California is the state with the largest number of Native American casinos (78), followed by Oklahoma (62) and Arizona (57). Texas has the fourth-largest number of tribal casinos (33), followed by Florida (29) and Michigan (28).</p>
<p>The growth of tribal gaming is benefiting rural communities as well as urban ones. A study by researchers at Northern Arizona University found that for every dollar spent at a tribal casino in a rural community, there was an additional $1.53 in economic impact. That’s because casinos generate significant spin-off spending in local businesses such as restaurants, hotels, and retail stores.</p>
<p>Tribal gaming is also helping to reverse long-standing trends of poverty and unemployment on Native American reservations. A study by the National Congress of American Indians found that in 2015, tribal gambling revenues helped to reduce poverty on reservations by 17 percent and unemployment by 19 percent. In addition, more than 60 percent of tribes using gambling revenues to support social programs reported improvements in areas such as health care, education, housing, and child welfare.</p>
<p>Critics of tribal gaming often claim that it contributes to negative social outcomes such as crime and gambling addiction. But empirical research does not support these claims. A study published in the journal Economic Inquiry found that “tribal casino income does not lead to increased crime rates or problems with pathological or problem gambling among tribe members…. [and] may even lead to reduced levels of crime rates and problems with pathological or problem gambling within tribes”<br>That’s because most tribes have extensive regulatory frameworks in place that help to minimize any negative social impacts of gambling. For example, most tribes require gamblers be at least 18 years old and prohibit those who are addicted to gambling from participating in gambling activities</p>
