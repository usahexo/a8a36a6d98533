            <h1 id="Jets-Fans-Are-Optimistic-in-the-Face-of-Changes"><a href="#Jets-Fans-Are-Optimistic-in-the-Face-of-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Jets Fans Are Optimistic in the Face of Changes"></a>Jets Fans Are Optimistic in the Face of Changes</h1><p>The New York Jets went through a lot of changes this offseason. The team traded away cornerback Darrelle Revis, and released wide receiver Santonio Holmes. These moves left some Jets fans pessimistic about the team’s chances for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>However, many Jets fans are still optimistic. They believe that the team’s new additions, including quarterback Geno Smith and wide receiver Eric Decker, will lead to success this year.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re going to be as bad as everyone is predicting,” said one Jets fan. “I think we’ll do well this year.”</p>
<p>Another Jets fan agreed, saying “I think we’ll surprise a lot of people this year. We’ve got a lot of good players on this team.”</p>
<p>The Jets open their preseason schedule on Thursday night against the Detroit Lions.</p>
<h1 id="Decker’s-Departure-Leaves-Big-Hole-for-Jets-to-Fill"><a href="#Decker’s-Departure-Leaves-Big-Hole-for-Jets-to-Fill" class="headerlink" title="Decker’s Departure Leaves Big Hole for Jets to Fill"></a>Decker’s Departure Leaves Big Hole for Jets to Fill</h1><p>The New York Jets have a big hole to fill at quarterback after the departure of Ryan Fitzpatrick. Geno Smith is currently the starting quarterback, but he is not a long-term solution. The Jets will need to find a quarterback in free agency or the draft.</p>
<p>There are several quarterbacks who could be available in free agency. The most prominent names are Sam Bradford, Kirk Cousins, and Mike Glennon. Bradford is the most experienced of the three, but he has had injury problems in the past. Cousins is coming off a successful season with the Washington Redskins, and Glennon has potential but has yet to prove himself.</p>
<p>The Jets may also be interested in Tony Romo if he is released by the Dallas Cowboys. Romo is coming off an injury-plagued season, but he is still one of the better quarterbacks in the league. He would be a major upgrade for the Jets and would likely make them contenders for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>The Jets could also draft a quarterback with the sixth overall pick. The top prospects include Deshaun Watson, DeShone Kizer, Mitchell Trubisky, and Patrick Mahomes II. Watson and Trubisky are both Heisman Trophy winners, while Kizer and Mahomes II are both developmental prospects who have high upside.</p>
<p>Whoever the Jets choose to quarterback their team next season, they will need to play well if they want to compete in a tough AFC East division</p>
<h1 id="Fitzpatrick-Signing-Puts-Pressure-on-Young-Players"><a href="#Fitzpatrick-Signing-Puts-Pressure-on-Young-Players" class="headerlink" title="Fitzpatrick Signing Puts Pressure on Young Players"></a>Fitzpatrick Signing Puts Pressure on Young Players</h1><p>It was a little under two weeks ago when the Jets made the decision to sign free agent linebacker Avery Williamson. At the time, it was a little puzzling because they already had a solid core of linebackers, including Darron Lee and Jordan Jenkins. Williamson is a good player, but he’s not an elite talent.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the signing to make sense though. On Monday, the Jets announced that they had released linebacker Demario Davis. The move clears up $6 million in cap space and creates an opening at middle linebacker.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall for Davis, but his release still came as a bit of a surprise. He led the Jets in tackles last season and was one of their most productive players. It’s clear that the team is putting pressure on its young players to step up and play at a higher level.</p>
<p>Lee, Jenkins, and safety Jamal Adams are all entering their third year in the league. This is an important year for them, as they need to start proving that they’re capable of leading the team into the future.</p>
<p>Adams seems to be on track, but Lee and Jenkins have both struggled at times. In fact, Jenkins was benched for most of the second half of last season. The Jets clearly aren’t happy with his production so far.</p>
<p>This offseason has been one of change for the Jets. They’ve released several veterans and replaced them with younger players. As mentioned earlier, Williamson is a good player, but he’s not a superstar. The goal is to find young players who can develop into stars over time.</p>
<p>The signing of Fitzpatrick gives the Jets some depth at quarterback, but it also puts pressure on Sam Darnold and Teddy Bridgewater to perform well this season. If either one of them struggles, Fitzpatrick will be there to take over.</p>
<p>There’s no question that this is a make-or-break year for Darnold and Bridgewater. They need to show that they can be successful quarterbacks in the NFL. If they can’t do that, then the Jets will likely go in another direction with their next quarterback draft pick</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Jets-Prepare-for-Season-with-Uncertainty-at-QB"><a href="#New-York-Jets-Prepare-for-Season-with-Uncertainty-at-QB" class="headerlink" title="New York Jets Prepare for Season with Uncertainty at QB"></a>New York Jets Prepare for Season with Uncertainty at QB</h1><p>The New York Jets have begun preparations for the upcoming season, but they do so with uncertainty under center. Josh McCown, who is coming off a solid season with the Jets, is a free agent and is not expected to return. The Jets have Bryce Petty and Christian Hackenberg competing for the starting quarterback job, but there is no clear favorite. Petty has starting experience in the NFL, while Hackenberg was a second-round pick in 2016 but has yet to play in an NFL game.</p>
<p>Adding to the Jets’ quarterback uncertainty is the fact that they may trade away veteran cornerback Darrelle Revis. Revis is scheduled to make $15 million this season, and the Jets may look to trade him before he becomes a salary-cap casualty. If Revis is traded, it would leave a big hole at cornerback. The Jets do have some young cornerbacks who could step up, but there is no clear replacement for Revis if he is traded.</p>
<p>The Jets also have some questions on defense. The team released defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson this offseason, and there are concerns about whether or not the defense will be able to generate a pass rush without him. The Jets do have some promising young players on defense, including linebacker Darron Lee and defensive end Leonard Williams. But it remains to be seen if they can make up for Wilkerson’s departure.</p>
<p>Overall, there are a lot of question marks surrounding the Jets as they head into the 2018 season. The quarterback situation is uncertain, the defense may not be able to generate a pass rush without Wilkerson, and Revis may be traded away. There are some promising young players on the team, but it remains to be seen if they can lead the Jets to success in 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Ryan-Fitzpatrick-Returns-to-the-Jets-After-a-Year-Away"><a href="#Ryan-Fitzpatrick-Returns-to-the-Jets-After-a-Year-Away" class="headerlink" title="Ryan Fitzpatrick Returns to the Jets After a Year Away"></a>Ryan Fitzpatrick Returns to the Jets After a Year Away</h1><p>The Jets are coming off a dismal 5-11 season and enter this offseason with many question marks. One of the most important questions they face is at the quarterback position. Sam Darnold, their first round pick in 2018, is the presumed starter, but there is no guarantee that he will be successful. The Jets could use a veteran presence to help guide Darnold through his first year and that’s where Ryan Fitzpatrick comes in.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick played for the Jets from 2015-2016, winning 10 games during that span. He was then released after the team acquired quarterback Josh McCown. Fitzpatrick spent the 2017 season with Tampa Bay and New Orleans, but was ultimately cut by both teams. Now, after a year away from the NFL, Fitzpatrick has decided to return to the Jets.</p>
<p>This news came as a surprise to many, as Fitzpatrick had previously stated that he was done playing football. In an interview with SiriusXM NFL Radio (via Pro Football Talk), Fitzpatrick said that he “started to get that itch again” and realized that he still wanted to play. He also mentioned that he wanted to play for a team that had a chance to win, which is why he chose the Jets over other potential options.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how long Fitzpatrick will stay with the Jets or how much playing time he will see behind Sam Darnold, but his experience and knowledge could be invaluable to the young QB. With training camp just around the corner, we’ll soon find out what role Fitzpatrick will play for the Jets this upcoming season.</p>
