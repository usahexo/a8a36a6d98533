This means that you can continue playing your favorite casino games while enjoying a few drinks.</p>
<p>This change was made in response to customer feedback. Previously, the casino stopped serving alcohol at 11pm. Many guests were not happy with this policy, as they felt that it cut their night short. Now, you can enjoy your favorite cocktails and spirits until midnight.</p>
<p>In addition to serving alcohol until midnight, Mount Airy Casino Resort is also offering a number of new promotions. These include $10,000 drawings every Friday and Saturday night, as well as a “lucky” $100,000 slot machine progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a place to enjoy some drinks and gamble late into the night, Mount Airy Casino Resort is the perfect destination.</p>
<h1 id="Drink-Responsibly-Mount-Airy-Casino-Serves-Alcohol-Until-11PM"><a href="#Drink-Responsibly-Mount-Airy-Casino-Serves-Alcohol-Until-11PM" class="headerlink" title="Drink Responsibly: Mount Airy Casino Serves Alcohol Until 11PM!"></a>Drink Responsibly: Mount Airy Casino Serves Alcohol Until 11PM!</h1><p>It’s no secret that Mount Airy Casino Resort is a great place to have some fun, but what you may not know is that the casino also offers great drinks! That’s right – whether you’re looking for a cold beer, mixed drink, or glass of wine, Mount Airy has you covered.</p>
<p>One of the best things about the casino’s drink selection is that you can enjoy them until 11PM! This is great news for those who want to enjoy an evening out at the casino without having to worry about getting too drunk.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s always important to drink responsibly no matter where you are. But with Mount Airy Casino Resort’s extended drink serving hours, you don’t have to worry about cutting your night short because you need to go home and sober up.</p>
<p>So next time you’re in the mood for some fun at the casino, be sure to stop by one of the many bars and enjoy a delicious drink!</p>
<h1 id="Mount-Airy-Casino-Serving-Alcohol-Later-Than-Other-Casinos-In-The-Area"><a href="#Mount-Airy-Casino-Serving-Alcohol-Later-Than-Other-Casinos-In-The-Area" class="headerlink" title="Mount Airy Casino Serving Alcohol Later Than Other Casinos In The Area!"></a>Mount Airy Casino Serving Alcohol Later Than Other Casinos In The Area!</h1><p>A recent article in The Morning Call of Allentown, PA reported that Mount Airy Casino Resort will be allowed to serve alcohol until 4am, while other casinos in the area are only allowed to serve until 2am.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board voted 3-2 in favor of granting the later hours to Mount Airy Casino. The vote came after a presentation by casino officials, who said they needed the later hours to remain competitive with casinos in other states.</p>
<p>The two dissenting board members were reportedly concerned about the impact of the longer hours on public safety. But casino officials argued that the majority of their customers are already drinking when they arrive and that extending alcohol service by two hours will not create any additional safety concerns.</p>
<p>Mount Airy Casino is located in Monroe County, which is adjacent to Northampton County, where the other casinos are located. So it’s no surprise that there has been some pushback from local officials about the extended hours.</p>
<p>But it appears that casino officials have successfully made their case, and drinkers in the area will now have an extra two hours to drink at Mount Airy Casino Resort!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Limits-Alcohol-Service-To-Curb-Problem-Gamblers"><a href="#Casino-Limits-Alcohol-Service-To-Curb-Problem-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Casino Limits Alcohol Service To Curb Problem Gamblers"></a>Casino Limits Alcohol Service To Curb Problem Gamblers</h1><p>Casinos in Nevada are cracking down on the availability of alcohol to curb problem gambling. The new regulations, which went into effect on January 1st, limit alcohol service to those 21 and older.</p>
<p>This is the latest effort by casinos to address a growing problem. In 2017, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported that problem gambling had increased by 28%. This increase has led to increased costs for casinos, as they deal with issues such as patrons who can’t pay their debts or who become violent.</p>
<p>The new regulations are an attempt to discourage problem gambling by making it more difficult for people to drink while gambling. They also require casinos to track how much alcohol is being served and make sure that people aren’t over-indulging.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that they hope the new regulations will help keep people safe and reduce the negative impacts of problem gambling. They also note that the regulations are just one part of a larger effort to address problem gambling, which includes education and treatment programs.</p>
<h1 id="Alcohol-Availability-Varies-At-Different-Pennsylvania-Casinos"><a href="#Alcohol-Availability-Varies-At-Different-Pennsylvania-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Alcohol Availability Varies At Different Pennsylvania Casinos"></a>Alcohol Availability Varies At Different Pennsylvania Casinos</h1><p>Pennsylvania casino fans will be interested in a new study that looked at the availability of alcohol at different casinos within the state. The study was conducted by the Institute for Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and it found that alcohol availability varied quite a bit from casino to casino.</p>
<p>Some casinos had very limited alcohol options, while others had a wide variety of alcoholic beverages available. For example, some casinos only offered beer and wine, while others had cocktails, liquor, and beer available.</p>
<p>The study also found that most casinos allowed patrons to bring their own alcohol into the casino. This is good news for those who like to drink while they gamble, as they can save money by bringing their own drinks into the casino.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the study also found that casinos with more restrictive alcohol policies tended to have lower rates of problem gambling. This suggests that limiting access to alcohol may help to curb problem gambling behavior.</p>
<p>While this is an interesting finding, it is important to note that further research is needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn. Overall, the findings of this study provide valuable information for Pennsylvania casino fans who are looking for a place to drink while they gamble.</p>
