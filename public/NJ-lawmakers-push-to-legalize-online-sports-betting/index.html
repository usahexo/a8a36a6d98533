<p>If the high court strikes down the law, New Jersey would be free to offer sports betting online, in person at casinos and racetracks, and by phone.</p>
<p>Republican state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, a leading advocate of online gambling, said he is “ cautiously optimistic ” that the court will rule in New Jersey’s favor.</p>
<p>“ We’re talking about billions of dollars being wagered illegally each year ,” Lesniak said. “This is a way to put that money back into the economy and generate tax revenue for the state .”</p>
<p>But not everyone is on board with the proposal. Some lawmakers and casino operators are concerned that legalization could cannibalize Atlantic City’s casino industry .</p>
<p>If New Jersey is successful in overturning the federal ban, it would become the second state (after Nevada) to offer legal sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Proposed-bill-would-make-online-sports-betting-legal-in-NJ"><a href="#Proposed-bill-would-make-online-sports-betting-legal-in-NJ" class="headerlink" title="Proposed bill would make online sports betting legal in NJ"></a>Proposed bill would make online sports betting legal in NJ</h1><p>A proposed bill in the New Jersey state legislature would legalize online sports betting, overturning a federal ban on the activity.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, Assembly Bill 4111, was introduced by Assemblyman Ralph Caputo on February 1st. The bill has been referred to the Assembly Tourism, Gaming and the Arts Committee for further consideration.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would allow New Jersey residents to place wagers on sporting events through licensed online sports betting operators. The bill would also require operators to pay a licensing fee and taxes on gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is intended to help boost New Jersey’s struggling gambling industry. In recent years, Atlantic City casinos have suffered from increased competition from other states, including neighboring Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In 2017, New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment that allowed for sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. However, the amendment could not be implemented until federal law was changed to allow it.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is opposed by several casino companies in Atlantic City, who argue that it will cannibalize their business. They also argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems in the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will create new jobs and tax revenue for the state. They also point out that many other forms of legalized gambling are already available in New Jersey, and that sports betting is no different.</p>
<h1 id="Could-New-Jersey-soon-have-legal-online-sports-betting"><a href="#Could-New-Jersey-soon-have-legal-online-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Could New Jersey soon have legal online sports betting?"></a>Could New Jersey soon have legal online sports betting?</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 26-year-old federal law that had effectively prohibited sports betting nationwide. The law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), made it illegal for states to authorize or regulate sports betting.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 decision, the justices ruled that the law violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution, which reserves power to the states. The ruling opens the door for other states to legalize sports betting, and could pave the way for New Jersey to finally offer legal online sports betting.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been trying to legalize online sports betting for years, but PASPA had prevented them from doing so. In 2012, state lawmakers passed a bill allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but it was vetoed by then-Governor Chris Christie.</p>
<p>The state again tried to legalize online sports betting in 2014, but this time the effort was blocked by a federal court. However, with PASPA now overturned, New Jersey is free to move forward with its plans to offer legal online sports betting.</p>
<p>There is already some indication that this may happen soon. On Monday, May 21st – just one day after the Supreme Court ruling – Governor Phil Murphy signed an executive order directing the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (NJDGE) to “expeditiously regulate” sports betting.</p>
<p>The NJDGE has already announced that it will begin accepting applications from casinos and racetracks wishing to offer legal online sports betting. It is expected that these applications will be approved in short order, and that New Jersey residents will be able to start placing bets on sporting events within weeks or months.</p>
<p>In addition to New Jersey, several other states are also likely to legalize sports betting in light of the Supreme Court ruling. These include Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi – all of which have recently passed laws authorizing such gambling.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much revenue legal online sports betting will bring in for states and casinos. However, there is no doubt that it will be a lucrative business – especially now that PASPA has been overturned.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-online-sports-betting-closer-to-reality-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Legal-online-sports-betting-closer-to-reality-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Legal online sports betting closer to reality in New Jersey?"></a>Legal online sports betting closer to reality in New Jersey?</h1><p>State senators in New Jersey have advanced a bill that could pave the way for legal sports betting in the state. The vote was 24-16, with one abstention.</p>
<p>The next step is for the bill to be heard in the state Assembly.</p>
<p>Governor Chris Christie has said he would sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.</p>
<p>Christie has been a vocal proponent of legal sports betting, saying it would help fortify the state’s struggling casino industry.</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently illegal in New Jersey, as it is in most states. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that individual states could decide whether to allow it.</p>
<p>Nevada is currently the only state where sports betting is legal. Delaware and Montana also have some limited sports betting.</p>
<p>If New Jersey does legalize sports betting, it’s not clear how soon casinos could start taking bets. The bill says regulators would have to come up with rules and regulations within 180 days of the bill becoming law.</p>

<p>The bill, which passed by a vote of 26-5, now heads to the Assembly for further consideration.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would allow Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer online sports betting. It would also establish regulations for online gambling companies doing business in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Governor Chris Christie has said he supports the measure and is expected to sign it into law if it is approved by the Assembly.</p>
