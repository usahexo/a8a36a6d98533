            <h1 id="What-is-the-capital-of-Turkey"><a href="#What-is-the-capital-of-Turkey" class="headerlink" title="What is the capital of Turkey?"></a>What is the capital of Turkey?</h1><p>Ankara, Turkey is the capital of the Republic of Turkey. It is also the second most populous city in Turkey after Istanbul. The city has a population of 4,587,028 as of 2019 and it is estimated to grow to 5 million by 2023.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-largest-cities-in-Turkey"><a href="#What-are-the-largest-cities-in-Turkey" class="headerlink" title="What are the largest cities in Turkey?"></a>What are the largest cities in Turkey?</h1><p>Turkey is a country located in both Europe and Asia. As of 2019, the population of Turkey is around 82 million people. The largest city in Turkey is Istanbul, which has a population of around 15 million people.</p>
<p>The second largest city in Turkey is Ankara, which has a population of around 5 million people. The third largest city in Turkey is Izmir, which has a population of around 4 million people.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-the-currency-of-Turkey"><a href="#What-is-the-currency-of-Turkey" class="headerlink" title="What is the currency of Turkey?"></a>What is the currency of Turkey?</h1><p>Today, the Turkish Lira is the currency of Turkey. It is made up of 100 kuruş and is often abbreviated as TL. The Turkish lira was first introduced in 1844, and it replaced the Ottoman gold lira. The Ottoman Empire had used several currencies, including the akçe, para, and kuruş.</p>
<p>The Turkish Lira has seen a lot of volatility in its value over the years. In 2009, it took about 2TL to buy 1USD. However, by early 2018, that number had grown to close to 4TL to buy 1USD. This dramatic decrease in value was largely due to political instability and concerns over inflation in Turkey. In August 2018, it was announced that the Turkish Lira would be replaced by the new Turkish Lira as the country’s official currency.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-climate-in-Turkey"><a href="#What-is-the-climate-in-Turkey" class="headerlink" title="What is the climate in Turkey?"></a>What is the climate in Turkey?</h1><p>The climate in Turkey is Mediterranean and continental.

The second-largest religion in Turkey is Christianity, followed by Judaism and other religions.</p>
<p>The most popular branch of Islam in Turkey is Sunni Islam, adhered to by about 73 percent of the Turkish Muslim population.
