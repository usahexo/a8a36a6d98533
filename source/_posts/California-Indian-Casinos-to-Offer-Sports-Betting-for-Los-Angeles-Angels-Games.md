#  California Indian Casinos to Offer Sports Betting for Los Angeles Angels Games

Major League Baseball's Opening Day is a week away, and some California Indian casinos are preparing to take sports bets on the Los Angeles Angels games.

The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians will offer sports betting on the Angels at its two Southern California casinos, Spa Resort Casino in Rancho Mirage and Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa in Palm Springs.

The Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians is also planning to take bets on the Angels at its casino in Temecula.

"We're just waiting for final approvals from the state," said Lynn Valbuena, a spokeswoman for the tribe.

Both tribes have been approved by the state to offer sports betting on other teams, but they must wait for regulatory approval to offer betting on specific teams.

Sports betting is expected to bring in additional revenue for the tribes. The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians already offers traditional casino gambling, as well as a hotel, spa and golf course. The Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians operates a similar resort and casino.

#  California Indian Casinos Jump into Sports Betting Market with Los Angeles Angels

The prevalence of Indian casinos in California has led to an interesting trend in the world of professional sports. Namely, the state’s Native American casinos are now getting involved in sports betting.

This is a major shift, as up until recently Indian casinos have been largely prohibited from taking part in sports betting. This is because the federal government has classified gambling on sporting events as a “protected activity”, meaning that it’s reserved for states that specifically allow it.

Given that California has not legalized sports betting, its Indian casinos have been limited to more traditional casino games like slot machines and blackjack. However, this all changed in May 2018 when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992.

PASPA was a federal law that essentially prohibited states from legalizing most forms of sports betting. However, the Supreme Court ruled that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution by forcing states to prohibit gambling on sporting events.

Now that PASPA is no longer in effect, Indian casinos in California are free to get involved in sports betting. And many of them are taking advantage of this opportunity, including the Pechanga Resort and Casino near Temecula.

Earlier this year, Pechanga teamed up with Churchill Downs Incorporated to launch an online sports betting platform called “PechangaBets”. The platform allows Pechanga customers to place bets on various sporting events, including NFL and NCAA football games, NBA and MLB games, and even eSports matches.

Other Indian casinos in California are also getting into the sports betting market. The Morongo Band of Mission Indians recently announced plans to open a new casino called “Sports Betting Morongo”, which will offer customers the ability to bet on everything from NFL games to horse races.

Meanwhile, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is planning to open a new sportsbook at its casino in Highland called “San Manuel Stadium Sports Book & Lounge”. The book will have 30 televisions for watching sporting events, as well as desktop computers where customers can place bets online.

It remains to be seen how successful these Indian casinos will be in the world of sports betting. But one thing is for sure: they’re giving traditional Nevada casinos a run for their money.

#  First California Indian Casino to Offer Sports Betting on Los Angeles Angels Games

The Augustine Casino in Thermal, California is the first Indian casino to offer sports betting on Los Angeles Angels games. The casino has a race and sports book, as well as a bar and grill.

The Augustine Casino is owned and operated by the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians. The tribe opened the casino in February of 2018.

Sports betting is now legal in California. The Augustine Casino is one of five casinos in the state that offers sports betting.

The other four casinos are all in the Reno area: Grand Sierra Resort, Atlantis Casino, Harrah’s Reno, and Silver Legacy Resort Casino.

In order to place a bet on a game, you must be at least 21 years old and present a valid ID. You can also bet through the casino’s mobile app.

The Augustine Casino offers a variety of betting options, including traditional point spread bets and over/under bets, as well as prop bets on things like player or team performance.

The Cabazon Band of Mission Indians is confident that their new sports book will be popular with both tribal members and non-members alike. “Our guests have told us they want this type of amenity and we are excited to provide it for them,” said tribal chairman Val encoding Jr..

#  California Indian Casino to Start Offering Sports Betting on the Los Angeles Angels

The Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula, California is one of the largest Indian casinos in the United States. It is now in the process of finalizing an agreement with sports book operator William Hill that would allow it to offer sports betting on the Los Angeles Angels.

This would be a huge development for both Pechanga and California's gambling market. The state currently has four tribal casinos that offer traditional casino games such as slots and blackjack, but they are not allowed to offer sports betting. This is because tribal casinos are regulated by the federal government, while traditional Nevada-style casinos are regulated by the state.

Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down the federal ban on sports betting, California's gambling market is expected to undergo a major transformation. Tribal casinos will now be able to offer sports betting, and there is already talk of expanding gambling into other parts of the state.

Pechanga is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. It already offers a wide variety of casino games, and it has a strong presence in Southern California. In addition, it has partnered with William Hill, one of the largest sports book operators in the world. This will give it access to some of the best technology and betting products in the industry.

It remains to be seen how much revenue Pechanga can generate from its sports betting operation, but there is certainly potential for growth. Sports betting is becoming increasingly popular, and California has a large population that is eager to bet on its favorite teams.

#  Which California Indian Casino Will Be the First to Offer Sports Betting on the Los Angeles Angels?

The new year has brought a flurry of news stories about the impending legalization of sports betting in California, with most of the focus on the possibility that the state's Indian casinos will get a head start on their Las Vegas counterparts.

It now appears that the first California casino to offer sports betting on the Los Angeles Angels will be the Morongo Casino Resort and Spa, which is located in Cabazon near Palm Springs. The Morongo tribe has been working on an agreement with William Hill US, one of the largest sportsbook operators in the country, to offer wagering on both professional and college sporting events.

If everything goes as planned, William Hill US will provide its sportsbook platform and staff to the Morongo Casino in order to get up and running quickly. Other tribes are also said to be in talks with various sportsbook operators, so it's likely that we'll see several California Indian casinos offering sports betting in the near future.

There are still some unresolved issues with regard to legalized sports betting in California, including how much tax revenue the tribes will have to pay and what types of bets will be allowed. But it's clear that there is a lot of interest in getting a piece of this rapidly growing industry, and we can expect to see a lot more news about sports betting in California over the next few months.
