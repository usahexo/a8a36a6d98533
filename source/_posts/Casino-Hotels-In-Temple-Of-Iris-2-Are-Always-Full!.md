#   Weekend occupancy rates at casino hotels in Temple of Iris 2 averaged at 95%!

The Temple of Iris 2 casino is booming, with occupancy rates at casino hotels averaging 95 percent on weekends.

Despite the increased competition from the new casino in Siren’s Bay, Temple of Iris 2’s hotel casinos are doing well. The Golden Palace, Emerald Palace and Diamond Palace are all reporting high occupancies on weekends.

According to hotel managers, the increase in business is mainly due to the expansion of the Temple of Iris 2 casino. With more games and attractions, visitors are spending more time and money at the casino.

In addition to the excellent occupancy rates, casino hotel guests are also spending more on food and beverages. This is good news for restaurateurs in Temple of Iris 2 who were experiencing a slowdown in business before the opening of the new casino.

The only downside to the increased business is that parking is becoming a problem. With so many people coming to Temple of Iris 2 for the weekend, there is not enough parking available near the casino hotels. Hotel managers are recommending that guests park their cars at one of the satellite parking lots and take the free shuttle to the casino.
