# Tips for Playing Fun88 Roulette

Here are some tips for making the most of playing Fun88 Roulette on Nightbot:

1) Use commands to control how the game plays. For example, use !bet 100 to bet 100 credits on each turn, or use !skip 30 to skip ahead 30 turns.

2) Use chat messages to interact with other players. For example, type "Happy Birthday!" in chat when it's someone's birthday to give them a bonus credit. Or try typing "Winner!" when you win a round to celebrate!

3) Use timers to keep track of how long you've been playing. This can be helpful if you want to take a break or end the game early. To add a timer, type !timer X into chat, where X is the number of minutes you want between rounds.

#  How to Make Your Own Roulette Game on Nightbot

In this article, we will show you how to make your own roulette game on Nightbot.

To get started, we need to create a new Nightbot command. To do this, open the Nightbot command editor by clicking on the Commands tab and then the New Command button:

Now we need to give our command a name. We'll call our command "roulette".

Next, we need to specify what our command does. For our roulette game, we'll use the following script:

!roulette [ bet amount ]

This will allow users to play roulette by betting a certain amount of tokens.

Now we need to set up the betting options. We'll do this by creating a new Nightbot variable. To do this, open the Variables tab and then click on the New Variable button:

We'll call our variable "bet_options". For the value, we'll enter the following:


{ "name": "Red", "amount": 1 }, { "name": "Black", "amount": 2 }, { "name": "Green", "amount": 3 }
 If you want to add more betting options, you can simply copy and paste the code above and change the values as needed.

Now we need to configure our Nightbot chat bot to accept bets. To do this, open the Settings tab and then click on the Chat Bot section:







 







   


As you can see, we need to enable the Use Variable for Command setting and set the bet_options variable to be used in our roulette game. Click on Save Changes when you're done.

Now it's time to test out our roulette game! To do this, type !roulette into Nightbot's chat window and then enter the amount you want to bet followed by "/ Red" or "/ Black" depending on which color you want to bet on:
