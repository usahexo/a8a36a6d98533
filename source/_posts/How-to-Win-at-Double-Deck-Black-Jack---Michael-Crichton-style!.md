#  Be a blackjack winner - follow Crichton's tips!

Casinos are always filled with people trying their luck at games of chance. And one of the most popular games in a casino is blackjack. It's easy to learn, and there's enough excitement and potential for big wins to make it interesting for everyone.

But there are a lot of people who playing blackjack - and if you're not careful, you can quickly find yourself on the losing side of the equation. That's why it's important to have a strategy in place before you sit down at the table.

And one of the best sources of blackjack advice is Michael Crichton's book, "Explaining Poker." In it, Crichton lays out a number of tips that will help you win more often:

The first rule is to never take insurance . Professional blackjack players never take insurance - because the odds are against you when you do. And since casinos make money by ensuring that players lose over the long term, it's in their best interest to offer insurance policies that are likely to be taken. So don't give them the opportunity - just skip this option altogether.

When you're dealt two cards of the same rank, your instinct may be to split them up and try to make two separate hands. But this is usually not a good idea, because you're statistically more likely to lose when you split pairs.

Instead, Crichton recommends doubling down on your initial hand if you have a good chance of winning . For example, if you're dealt an Ace and a Ten, and the dealer has a low card showing (say 2-6), then doubling down would be a smart move. This increases your chances of winning by giving yourself another card and betting twice as much as your original bet.

#  Learn the secrets to winning at double deck black jack from Michael Crichton

If you want to know how to beat the odds at the casino and win big playing double deck blackjack, then keep reading. In this article, Michael Crichton – a professional gambler and blackjack expert – is going to teach you everything he knows about the game.

When it comes to double deck blackjack, there are a few things you need to know in order to give yourself the best chance of winning:

1) The first thing you need to understand is how the dealer’s cards are used. In most cases, the dealer will use one card from the bottom of the deck and one card from the top of the deck. This means that they have a higher chance of busting if they have a low card showing.

2) The second thing you need to understand is that blackjack pays out 3:2. This means that if you bet $10 and get blackjack, you will get paid out $15 instead of just $10.

3) The third thing you need to understand is basic strategy. Basic strategy dictates which cards you should hit or stand on depending on your hand and the dealer’s up card. You can find basic strategy charts online which will show you exactly what to do in every possible scenario.

4) The fourth thing you need to understand is when to split pairs. If you are dealt two cards of the same value, then you can choose to split them into two separate hands. This increases your chances of winning by giving yourself more options. However, it also increases your chances of losing money, so make sure you only split pairs when it’s statistically advantageous to do so.

5) The fifth and final thing you need to know is when to surrender. If your hand is weak and the dealer has a high card showing, then you may want to surrender rather than risk losing more money. Surrendering allows you to lose half your bet rather than all of it, so it’s usually a good option if you think your hand isn’t going to win anyway.

Now that you know what you need to do in order to win at double deck blackjack, it’s time for some practice! Head down to your local casino and start playing today!

In his book, “Playing Games: How to Win at Double Deck Black Jack, Craps, Roulette, Baccarat and Casino Poker,” Crichton provides readers with an in-depth look at how to beat some of the most popular casino games.

Crichton first covers the basics of each game, providing players with a strong foundation before getting into more advanced strategies.

If you can stick to the basics and avoid making costly mistakes, you’ll be well on your way to winning at blackjack. But if you really want to give yourself an edge over the competition, you need to learn about card counting. Card counting is a technique that allows players to keep track of the high and low cards in order to make informed decisions about when to bet and when to hold back.

Of course, card counting takes a lot of practice – but it’s definitely worth learning if you want to become a serious blackjack player. And if blackjack isn’t your thing, don’t worry – Crichton has tips for winning at craps, roulette, baccarat and casino poker too!
