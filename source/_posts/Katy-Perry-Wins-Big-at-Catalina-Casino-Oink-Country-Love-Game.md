#  Katy Perry Wins Big at Catalina Casino Oink Country Love Game

Pop singer Katy Perry was the big winner at the Catalina Casino Oink Country Love game over the weekend, walking away with $2.2 million after hitting a royal flush.

The multi-millionaire singer took to her Instagram account shortly after winning to share her excitement with her followers, posting a picture of herself grinning and holding up her winnings. "Woo hoo!" she captioned the post.

The casino game, which is based on the classic card game poker, is popular among celebrities and high rollers alike, with previous winners including rapper Wiz Khalifa and motivational speaker Tony Robbins.

Catalina Casino spokesperson Stephanie Hernandez praised Perry for her prowess at the game, telling reporters that it was "clear she knows how to handle a deck of cards." Hernandez also hinted that the casino may be inviting Perry back to try her luck again in the near future.

For Perry, who is no stranger to big wins, the latest victory comes as another happy chapter in an already successful year. The pop star's latest album, Witness, topped the charts in dozens of countries upon its release earlier this year, and she has been touring extensively in support of it ever since.

#  Blake Shelton Dominates Catalina Casino Oink Country Love Game

On Saturday night, Blake Shelton and his band of rowdy friends from Oink Country Love dominated the stage at Catalina Casino in Avalon, California. The country superstar had the crowd in the palm of his hand from beginning to end, delivering hit after hit including "God Gave Me You," "Honey Bee," and "Ol' Red."

Catalina Casino is a historical landmark located on Santa Catalina Island, just off the coast of Southern California. The casino first opened its doors in July 1929 and has since become a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.

Saturday night's show was part of Shelton's ongoing tour in support of his latest album, Texoma Shore. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart upon release last November, and spawned the hits "I'll Name the Dogs" and "God's Country."

Shelton is no stranger to success, having sold over 30 million records throughout his career. He has also won numerous awards, including six Grammy Awards and three CMA Awards. But despite his impressive resume, Shelton remains down-to-earth and relatable to fans both old and new.

Speaking with reporters backstage before Saturday's show, Shelton said he was looking forward to getting back on the road and playing for his fans.

"I love it," he said. "I love playing live. I love being around my band and crew. We have a good time."

Shelton also took a moment to reflect on how far he has come since first starting out in music more than 20 years ago.

"It's been a long time – a long time – since I started doing this," he said. "It seems like it was just yesterday that I was up in Nashville trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life."

With a busy year ahead that includes another stint as a judge on NBC's hit singing competition show The Voice, Shelton shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. And judging by the enthusiastic response from fans at Catalina Casino on Saturday night, it seems safe to say that country music's bad boy is still very much at the top of his game.

The game, which benefits the USO, is played like a traditional golf tournament, with teams of two competing in a series of challenges for the chance to sink a putt and win the hole.

According to organizers, the event raised over $250,000 for the USO this year.

Dierks Bentley suffered an unexpected loss at Catalina Casino in the Oink Country Love game. The popular country singer was vying for the $100,000 prize, but fell short of taking home the top spot.

Despite Bentley’s clear talent and following, underdog Daryl Worley managed to edge him out, earning the title of champion and the big payday.

The competition was tight throughout the entire game, with both singers neck and neck for most of the rounds. In the end, it was Worley’s superior final score that pushed him past Bentley for the win.

Bentley took to social media after the game to express his disappointment, but also congratulated Worley on his hard-earned victory. “Had a blast playing tonight at Catalina Casino and congrats to Daryl Worley on winning! #OinkCountryLove,” he wrote.

Worley was understandably elated after emerging victorious in a contest against one of country music’s biggest stars. He took to Instagram to celebrate his big win with a heartfelt message. “Thank you Jesus! What an honor it was to play against @dierksbentley tonight! You are an amazing artist and friend! love y’all!,” he said.
