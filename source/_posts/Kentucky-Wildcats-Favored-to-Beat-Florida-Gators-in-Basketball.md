#  Kentucky Wildcats Favored to Beat Florida Gators in Basketball

The Kentucky Wildcats are favored to beat the Florida Gators in college basketball by 6.5 points, according to the latest odds from offshore sportsbook Bovada.

The Wildcats (21-9) are coming off a 73-71 home win over Tennessee on Saturday. They are led by sophomore guard Hamidou Diallo, who is averaging 17.1 points and 4.8 rebounds per game.

The Gators (19-11) are coming off a 71-69 home win over Vanderbilt on Saturday. They are led by freshman guard Andrew Nembhard, who is averaging 9.2 points and 5.4 assists per game.

Kentucky has won five of the last six meetings between the two teams, including a 79-59 victory in their last meeting on February 3, 2018.

#  Kentucky Considers Odds Ahead of Showdown Versus Florida

The Kentucky Wildcats will be looking to pick up a big win over the Florida Gators on Saturday. The Wildcats are currently +7 point underdogs, according to OddsShark, and they will need a strong performance from their players in order to pull off the upset.

One player who could be key for Kentucky is freshman forward Kevin Knox. Knox has been impressive so far this season, averaging 15.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. He will need to be aggressive against the Gators and take advantage of their defense.

Another player who could make a difference for the Wildcats is freshman guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Gilgeous-Alexander has been very solid this season, averaging 14.3 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game. He will need to take control of the offense and make sure that Kentucky is able to score consistently against Florida.

If Kentucky can play well as a team and get some big performances from their players, then they have a chance to pull off the upset on Saturday. The Wildcats are facing a strong opponent in Florida, but they should not be counted out just yet.

#  Kentucky vs Florida Betting Line Released

As the college basketball season gears up, two of the preseason favorites in the Southeastern Conference are set to face off. The Kentucky Wildcats, coming into the season with a No. 1 ranking, will battle against the Florida Gators who are ranked No. 7.

While these two schools have always been rivals, this year’s matchup is expected to be especially intense, with both teams looking to make an early statement in the SEC race.

The Wildcats are led by freshman phenom Kevin Knox and sophomore guard Hamidou Diallo. Both players are expected to make a big impact this year and could potentially lead Kentucky to their ninth title.

The Gators, on the other hand, are led by senior guard KeVaughn Allen and junior forward Kevarrius Hayes. While they may not have as much star power as Kentucky, Florida is nonetheless considered a very strong team and should not be underestimated.

When it comes to betting on this game, there is no clear favorite. The Wildcats are currently slight favorites at -2.5 points, but the line could easily go either way.

If you’re looking to place a bet on this game, there are a number of different options available. You can bet on who will win the game outright, or you can bet on individual players to score more or less points than expected. You can also bet on whether or not there will be over or under 150 points scored in the game.

#  Wildcats a 7-Point Favorite Over the Gators

 Wildcats head coach John Calipari has been vocal in his disdain for the new NCAA rules, but his team has responded well to the challenge, going 2-0 against top-10 opponents. Florida (+7) will be their latest test, and while the Gators have some talent, they don’t matchup well against Kentucky.

The Wildcats are led by freshman point guard Quade Green, who is averaging 11.5 points and 5.5 assists per game. Green is an all-around player who can score, pass and defend, and he should be able to dominate Florida’s inexperienced guards. In addition, Kentucky has plenty of other weapons, including Hamidou Diallo (14.5 PPG), Kevin Knox (13.5 PPG) and PJ Washington (10.0 PPG).

The Gators have some talented players of their own, including Jalen Hudson (17.8 PPG) and Chris Chiozza (10.0 PPG), but they are going to need a lot more from their other players if they want to stay close with Kentucky. The Wildcats are a 7-point favorite in this one, and I expect them to win by at least that margin.

#  Wildcats Poised to Extend Winning Streak Against the Gators

Going into their matchup against the Florida Gators, the Wildcats are favored to win and extend their current winning streak. The Wildcats have not lost a game since November and will be looking to keep that streak going.

Both teams are coming into this game with something to prove. The Wildcats are looking to continue their impressive winning streak while the Gators are looking to show that they can compete with the best teams in the country.

The Wildcats have been led by their star player, Harry Giles III. Giles III is averaging over 16 points per game and has been a dominant force on both ends of the court. He will be facing off against one of the best players in the country, Devin Robinson, who is averaging over 14 points per game.

The Wildcats will also need to rely on their other players if they want to come away with a win. Malik Monk, Isaiah Briscoe, and De'Aaron Fox all average in double figures and will need to play well if the Wildcats want to win.

The Gators have been led by their star player, Devin Robinson. Robinson is averaging over 14 points per game and is one of the most explosive players in the country. He will be facing off against Harry Giles III, who is one of the best players in the country.

The Gators also have other players who will need to step up if they want to compete with the Wildcats. Kasey Hill and John Egbunu are both averaging in double figures and will need to play well if they want to win.
