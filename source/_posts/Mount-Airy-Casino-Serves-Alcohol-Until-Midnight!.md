#  Mount Airy Casino Serving Alcohol Later Than Other Casinos In The Area!

A recent article in The Morning Call of Allentown, PA reported that Mount Airy Casino Resort will be allowed to serve alcohol until 4am, while other casinos in the area are only allowed to serve until 2am.

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board voted 3-2 in favor of granting the later hours to Mount Airy Casino. The vote came after a presentation by casino officials, who said they needed the later hours to remain competitive with casinos in other states.

The two dissenting board members were reportedly concerned about the impact of the longer hours on public safety. But casino officials argued that the majority of their customers are already drinking when they arrive and that extending alcohol service by two hours will not create any additional safety concerns.

Mount Airy Casino is located in Monroe County, which is adjacent to Northampton County, where the other casinos are located. So it's no surprise that there has been some pushback from local officials about the extended hours.

But it appears that casino officials have successfully made their case, and drinkers in the area will now have an extra two hours to drink at Mount Airy Casino Resort!

#  Casino Limits Alcohol Service To Curb Problem Gamblers

Casinos in Nevada are cracking down on the availability of alcohol to curb problem gambling. The new regulations, which went into effect on January 1st, limit alcohol service to those 21 and older.

This is the latest effort by casinos to address a growing problem. In 2017, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported that problem gambling had increased by 28%. This increase has led to increased costs for casinos, as they deal with issues such as patrons who can't pay their debts or who become violent.

The new regulations are an attempt to discourage problem gambling by making it more difficult for people to drink while gambling. They also require casinos to track how much alcohol is being served and make sure that people aren't over-indulging.

Casino officials say that they hope the new regulations will help keep people safe and reduce the negative impacts of problem gambling. They also note that the regulations are just one part of a larger effort to address problem gambling, which includes education and treatment programs.

#  Alcohol Availability Varies At Different Pennsylvania Casinos

Pennsylvania casino fans will be interested in a new study that looked at the availability of alcohol at different casinos within the state. The study was conducted by the Institute for Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and it found that alcohol availability varied quite a bit from casino to casino.

Some casinos had very limited alcohol options, while others had a wide variety of alcoholic beverages available. For example, some casinos only offered beer and wine, while others had cocktails, liquor, and beer available.

The study also found that most casinos allowed patrons to bring their own alcohol into the casino. This is good news for those who like to drink while they gamble, as they can save money by bringing their own drinks into the casino.

Interestingly, the study also found that casinos with more restrictive alcohol policies tended to have lower rates of problem gambling. This suggests that limiting access to alcohol may help to curb problem gambling behavior.

While this is an interesting finding, it is important to note that further research is needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn. Overall, the findings of this study provide valuable information for Pennsylvania casino fans who are looking for a place to drink while they gamble.
