#  Rare Chance to Discover the Seychelles Double!

The Seychelles Double can be a rare chance to see two very different sides of this amazing country.  On the one hand, there’s the bustling city life of Victoria on Mahé Island, with its shops, restaurants and nightlife. Then there are the pristine beaches and lush jungles of the outer islands. 

Getting from one side of the Seychelles to the other is easy, with regular flights between Victoria and the other airports on Praslin and La Digue. If you have time, I definitely recommend spending a few days exploring each side of the country.

Victoria is a great place to start your trip. It’s home to the Seychelles’ only international airport, so most visitors arrive here first. The city is located on Mahé Island, which is also home to some of the best beaches in the Seychelles. There’s plenty to do in Victoria, from shopping for locally made souvenirs to enjoying a drink or dinner overlooking the harbour.

If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Victoria, take a flight or ferry to one of the other islands. Praslin is home to Vallee de Mai National Park, which has some of the most beautiful jungle scenery in the country. La Digue is famous for its laid-back atmosphere and picture-perfect beaches.

No matter where you go in the Seychelles, you’re guaranteed an amazing experience. So if you get a chance to visit this incredible country, don’t miss out – book your trip today!

#  Get a Second Chance at Seeing the Seychelles!

If you didn’t get a chance to visit the Seychelles on your last trip, don’t worry – there’s still time to plan a vacation and check out this stunning destination. Just imagine beautiful white-sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, and lush green forests…plus, you can enjoy a wide range of activities such as swimming, snorkeling, diving, and hiking.

One great way to see the Seychelles is on a cruise. This will give you the opportunity to visit some of the smaller islands in addition to the main island of Mahé. You might also want to consider staying at a luxury beach resort – these often offer wonderful amenities such as infinity pools and spa treatments.

No matter how you choose to experience the Seychelles, make sure to take some time to relax and enjoy the incredible beauty of this destination.

#  See the Seychelles Two Times in One Trip!

Anyone looking for an amazing honeymoon destination should look no further than the Seychelles. This small archipelago nation consists of 115 islands off the coast of East Africa, and is well known for its white-sand beaches, crystal clear waters, coral reefs, and lush tropical vegetation.

What's even better is that you can see the Seychelles two times in one trip! The main island of Mahé is home to the international airport and the capital city of Victoria. From there, it's easy to take day trips to some of the other smaller islands.

For example, Praslin, located just a few miles away, is known for its stunning beaches, like Anse Lazio which was voted one of the top ten beaches in the world.
