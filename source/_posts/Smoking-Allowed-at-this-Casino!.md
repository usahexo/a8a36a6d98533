#  Smoking Allowed at this Casino!

Smoking is allowed in designated areas at the Casino! This makes it a great place for smokers to enjoy their favorite pastime. The Casino also has a wide variety of games, making it a great place to spend an afternoon or evening.

#  No More Smoking Bans at this Casino!

The Lucky Eagle Casino has announced that they will no longer be enforcing their smoking ban. This comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been a non-smoking establishment since 2007. In fact, it was one of the first in the area to adopt such a policy.

The change in policy is due to recent changes in Washington state law. A new law went into effect on July 23 that prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting smoking bans stricter than those set by the state. This means that municipalities can no longer prohibit smoking in places like bars and casinos.

The Lucky Eagle Casino is not the only business in the area to make this change. The Quinault Beach Resort and Casino announced last week that they would also be lifting their smoking ban.

Public health advocates are unhappy with the decision, arguing that it will lead to more secondhand smoke exposure for workers and patrons. However, supporters of the change argue that it is their right to smoke if they choose, and that businesses should be allowed to make their own decisions about smoking policies.

#  Casino Welcomes Smokers!

Casinos have been around since the late 1800s, and in that time, they’ve evolved into a global phenomenon. There are now dozens of casinos all over the world, and each one has its own quirks and charms.

One thing that all casinos have in common, though, is their smoking policy. Casinos are typically very welcoming to smokers, and many provide specifically designated smoking areas where guests can light up without fear of reproach.

This may seem like a strange policy, but there’s actually a lot of logic behind it. For one, casinos make a lot of money from cigarettes. Not only do smokers spend more money than nonsmokers, but they also tend to stay in the casino longer. This means that casinos can make more money off of them in the long run.

Additionally, smokers often find it difficult to quit smoking, and by providing a place where they can smoke freely, casinos are helping to keep people addicted to cigarettes. This is good for business, as it means that smokers are likely to keep coming back to the casino.

Ultimately, smoking policies vary from casino to casino, so be sure to check out the specific rules before you light up. But overall, you can rest assured that most casinos are happy to have smokers on their premises!
