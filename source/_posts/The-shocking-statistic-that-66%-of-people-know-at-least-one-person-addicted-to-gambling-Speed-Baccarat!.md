#  The shocking statistic that 66% of people know at least one person addicted to gambling Speed Baccarat!

According to a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling, 66% of people know at least one person addicted to gambling. This number is incredibly high and underscores the seriousness of the problem.

Gambling addiction can be incredibly destructive, both for the individual and for their loved ones. It can lead to financial problems, health issues, and even criminal behavior.

If you know someone who is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to get them help. There are many resources available, both online and in-person. You can also reach out to a support group for families of people with gambling addictions.

It is also important to be supportive and understanding towards your loved one. Gambling addiction can be very difficult to overcome, so don't be disappointed if they relapse from time to time. Just keep providing your support and continue to urge them to seek help.

The National Council on Problem Gambling offers a number of resources on their website, including a helpline, chat room, and information about treatment programs.

# 4. Gambling addiction experts say that Speed Baccarat is one of the most addictive games around.5. More people are becoming addicted to gambling Speed Baccarat – are you one of them?

6. Speed Baccarat is a very fast-paced game that can easily suck you in and before you know it, you’ve lost all your money.

7. The game is simple to play but can be very difficult to win, which is why so many people become addicted to it.

8. To play Speed Baccarat, all you need is a deck of cards and some willing participants.

9. The dealer deals out two cards to each player and two cards to themselves – the aim of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible.

10. If one of the players has a card value of 8 or 9, they immediately ‘stand’ and the other player can only draw one more card. If neither player has an 8 or 9, then the player with the highest value card goes first and can either draw one more card or stand.

11. The Ace is worth 1 point, 2-9 are worth face value and 10s and Jacks are worth 0 points (also called ‘baccarat’).

12. If the player draws another card and this takes their total over 10, then the first digit is ignored (so a total of 17 would be counted as 7). This rule also applies to baccarat (so a total of 9 would be counted as 0).

13. If both players have the same total, then it’s a ‘draw’ and nobody wins or loses anything.

14. The aim of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible – if you go over 9, then your score is reset back to 0 (i.e. you start counting again from 1).
