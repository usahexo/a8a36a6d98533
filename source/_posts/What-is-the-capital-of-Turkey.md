#  What is the currency of Turkey?

Today, the Turkish Lira is the currency of Turkey. It is made up of 100 kuruş and is often abbreviated as TL. The Turkish lira was first introduced in 1844, and it replaced the Ottoman gold lira. The Ottoman Empire had used several currencies, including the akçe, para, and kuruş.

The Turkish Lira has seen a lot of volatility in its value over the years. In 2009, it took about 2TL to buy 1USD. However, by early 2018, that number had grown to close to 4TL to buy 1USD. This dramatic decrease in value was largely due to political instability and concerns over inflation in Turkey. In August 2018, it was announced that the Turkish Lira would be replaced by the new Turkish Lira as the country's official currency.
