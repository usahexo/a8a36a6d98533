For a simple vinaigrette, you'll need olive oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Start by mixing together the vinegar and oil until the mixture is emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If the dressing is too thick, you can add a little water to thin it out.

Ranch dressing is made with buttermilk, sour cream, mayonnaise, onion powder, garlic powder, dill weed, and black pepper. To make ranch dressing, simply mix all of the ingredients together until smooth. If the dressing is too thick, you can add a little milk or water until it reaches the desired consistency.
