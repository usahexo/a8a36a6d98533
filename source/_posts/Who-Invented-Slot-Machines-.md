#  Who Invented Slot Machines? 
Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. But who invented them?

The first slot machine was created by Charles Fey in California in 1895. Fey was a car mechanic who had been working on a new type of telephone exchange when he came up with the idea for the slot machine. His first machine was called the Liberty Bell, and it quickly became popular in casinos across California.

Fey's Liberty Bell machine was based on a poker game called Draw Poker. It had three spinning reels, each with five symbols on it: hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs, and cherries. The aim of the game was to match three symbols on a reel to win a prize.

Slot machines quickly became very popular in casinos, and Fey soon started to manufacture them on a large scale. In fact, by 1897 there were more than 500 slot machines in operation across California. 

 Slot machines continued to grow in popularity throughout the 20th century. In fact, they became so popular that by the late 1990s they were responsible for more than 70% of casino profits worldwide. 

Today, there are thousands of different types of slot machines available at casinos around the world. But all of them owe their origins to Charles Fey's Liberty Bell machine from 1895.

#  Slot Machine Inventor Dies in Vegas 

The inventor of the slot machine, Charles Fey, died in his home in Las Vegas at the age of 100.

Fey was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States when he was a young man. He worked as a mechanic for several years before inventing the slot machine in 1895. His invention soon became popular in casinos across the country.

Fey continued to work on new slot machine designs throughout his life. In 1976, he was awarded a patent for his "multi-coin" slot machine.

Despite his success, Fey remained a modest man. He never accepted any awards or financial compensation for his invention. In fact, he is reported to have said, "I didn't invent the slot machine so I could get rich; I invented it so people could have some fun."

Charles Fey will be remembered as one of the most important figures in casino history. His legacy will continue to bring enjoyment to millions of people around the world.

#  Slot Machine Pioneer Dies at 104 

Walter J. Trump, the inventor of the modern slot machine, has passed away at the age of 104. Trump's slot machines were an instant hit when they first hit casinos in 1964 and revolutionized the gambling industry. While his slot machines are now commonplace in casinos around the world, they were a novelty at the time and helped to propel Trump to become one of the richest men in America.

Born in 1909, Trump was always interested in machines and tinkering with them. He began developing his slot machine design while working as a mechanic at a local Ford dealership. After several prototypes, he finally settled on a design that used tubes instead of levers to control the reels. This made it easier for users to play and increased the chances of winning.

Casinos were initially skeptical of Trump's invention, but he was able to convince them to give them a try by installing them in his own business. The slots quickly became popular and other casinos started installing them as well. Within a few years, Trump's machines had captured a sizable market share and he was raking in millions of dollars in profits.

Despite his success, Trump remained humble and down-to-earth throughout his life. He was known for generously donating to charities and supporting various causes. In fact, he never took out a patent for his invention so that anyone could copy it without paying him any royalties.

Trump is survived by his wife and four children. He will be remembered as one of the pioneers of the gaming industry and as someone who helped make gambling more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

#  Woman Claim to Invent Slot Machines 

A woman has come forward to say she invented the slot machine, a claim that if true would make her one of the most important contributors to gambling history.

The woman, who has not been identified, is said to have filed a patent for her invention in 1932. The patent application reportedly describes a machine with three spinning reels, on which players could bet between one and three coins.

If the woman’s claim is verified it would mean that slot machines were invented two decades before the first ones were actually built. Тhis could open up a can of worms for casinos around the world, as many may have to refund past wins and pay out damages to players who were unfairly taken advantage of.

The story was broken by NBC News affiliate KSNV in Las Vegas, who managed to track down the inventors’ granddaughter. She told reporters that her grandmother had showed her an old newspaper clipping about the patent filing but that she had never seen the actual machine.

Unfortunately, without the original machine or documentation to back up the claim, it’s likely that this story will remain unresolved. Nevertheless, it’s an interesting piece of gambling history that is sure to spark plenty of debate among casino fans.

Las Vegas, NV - Inventor of the slot machine, Hubert Essert, is in the United States Congress this week to testify in favor of a bill that would allow casinos to offer his invention. The 83-year-old Frenchman told The Huffington Post he was "very happy" to finally be able to talk to lawmakers about his invention and how it could help boost the economy.

"I invented the slot machine in 1932," said Essert. "It's been a long time coming." casinos have pushed for the right to offer the machines, saying they could help revive tourism in some areas of the country. Slot machines are currently banned in all but four states.

Essert's trip to Washington has been almost as long as his wait for the invention to be accepted. He arrived in the U.S. on Sunday and has met with Congressional staffers and members of the gaming industry. On Wednesday he will testify before the House Judiciary Committee at a hearing on H.R. 2267, the Micro Transactions Prohibition Act of 2011, which would legalize slot machines on Indian reservations and in other gambling areas across the country.

The bill is sponsored by Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA) The measure would also give states the option of legalizing slots outside of Vegas and Atlantic City, something state governments have been pushing for since gambling went online several years ago.
