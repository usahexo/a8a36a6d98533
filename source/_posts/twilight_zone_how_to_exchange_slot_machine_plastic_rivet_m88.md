# Twilight Zone: How to Exchange Slot Machine Plastic Rivet

The Twilight Zone slot machine is a popular game found in many casinos. Like any machine, it may require maintenance or repairs from time to time. One common issue that can arise is a broken plastic rivet that holds the reel strips in place. This can cause the reels to slip or not spin properly. Fortunately, replacing the plastic rivet is a relatively easy fix that can be done with just a few tools and some basic knowledge.

## What is a Plastic Rivet?

A plastic rivet is a type of fastener that is commonly used in machinery to hold parts together. It is made of plastic and has a cylindrical shape with a head on one end. The rivet is inserted through a hole and then the end is melted to form a head, creating a permanent bond.

## Tools and Materials Needed

To replace a broken plastic rivet on a Twilight Zone slot machine, you will need the following tools and materials:

- New plastic rivets
- Phillips-head screwdriver
- Pliers
- Heat gun or lighter

You can purchase new plastic rivets from an online retailer or a local hardware store. Be sure to choose a size that matches the old rivet.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Turn off the power to the slot machine and unplug it from the wall.
2. Remove the top of the machine by unscrewing the screws on the back of the machine and lifting off the top.
3. Locate the broken plastic rivet that needs to be replaced.
4. Using pliers, grip the head of the broken rivet and pull it out of the slot machine.
5. Take the new plastic rivet and insert it through the hole where the broken rivet was removed.
6. Use a heat gun or lighter to melt the end of the rivet to form a head. Be careful not to melt the plastic too much or damage the surrounding components.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for any additional broken rivets.
8. Replace the top of the slot machine and screw it back in place.
9. Plug the slot machine back in and turn on the power to ensure the reels are spinning properly.

## Conclusion

If your Twilight Zone slot machine is experiencing issues with slipping or not spinning properly, a broken plastic rivet could be the culprit. By following these simple steps and using the right tools and materials, you can easily replace the broken rivet and get your machine back to working properly. As always, exercise caution when working with any electrical equipment and consult a professional if you are unsure about any aspect of the repair process.
